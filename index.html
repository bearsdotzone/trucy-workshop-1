    <!-- img is an image, src points to a local file or a URL on the web for
    display. Specifying only width or height will maintain your image's aspect
    ratio. -->
    <!-- alt is an optional but encouraged tag that will describe your image to
    screen readers. If you want to learn more about making your website
    accessible, both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools for that express
    purpose. Lighthouse in Chrome and Accessibility in Firefox -->
