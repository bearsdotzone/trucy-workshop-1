<!-- While browsers can be very clever, it's best to assume that a DOCTYPE,
html, head, and body tag are the minimum necessary parts of an HTML website. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Page two!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Page two coming soon! <a href="index.html">Back!</a>
